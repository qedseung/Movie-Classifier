# Movie-Classifier
Machine learning program using a bag of words approach, along with both a Random Forest and Naive Bayes classifier to classify movie descriptions as drama, comedy, animated or action/adventure. Code is written in Python.

The training set was put together from the Open Movie DataBase, and the "||" symbol was used as delimiter so as not to confuse the parser by spurious characters in the movie decription.

##Getting Started
1. Install Python along with the numpy and sklearn packages via PIP
2. Download the movieClass.py and the training set, make sure they're in the same directory
3. Near the bottom of the movieClass.py file is an array (rts) of test inputs, decribing various movies and tv shows, modify this array to try different movie or tv descriptions. 
4. Run in console "Python movieClass.py"
